abstract: Artificial intelligence has become an important tool in fight against
  COVID-19. Machine learning models for COVID-19 global pandemic predictions
  have shown a higher accuracy than the previously used statistical models used
  by epidemiologists. With the advent of quantum machine learning, we present a
  comparative analysis of continuous variable quantum neural networks
  (variational circuits) and quantum backpropagation multilayer perceptron
  (QBMLP). We analyze the convoluted and sporadic data of two affected
  countries, and hope that our study will help in effective modeling of outbreak
  while throwing a light on bright future of quantum machine learning.
